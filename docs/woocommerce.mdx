This feature helps to reduce the time spent on creating individual product listings by automating the process for several products at once.

:::caution

Before you begin, it's recommended to use the Bulk Writer for a **few products first and see the results**. Once you're satisfied with the output, you can select more products. This ensures that you don't generate content for a large number of products only to find that the output doesn't meet your expectations.

:::

Below, you'll find a step-by-step guide on how to use this powerful feature.

- Go to **Settings - WooCommerce** and adjust your default values.
- Navigate to **WooCommerce > Products > All Products** from the left-hand side menu.

- Here, you can select one or multiple products for which you want to generate content.
- After selecting your products, click on the **Generate Content** button.
- A message will pop up, displaying the current settings for content generation.
- Along with the message, *"This will generate content for {n} products. Do you want to continue?"*. {n} is the number of products you have selected.

- If you are happy with your settings and ready to proceed, click **Start**. This will start the process of generating content for the selected products. A progress bar will appear, indicating the progress of the content generation.

<img src={Bulk3} />

- Once the content generation process is complete, you can review the generated content for each product. This can be done by navigating to each individual product page.

That's it! You've now successfully used the WooCommerce Bulk Product Writer to generate content for multiple products simultaneously.

Please remember to check and adhere to any API rate limits when using this feature.

Also, don't forget that you can adjust the default settings for the content generation through **Settings > WooCommerce** in your WordPress dashboard.

This allows you to customize the generated content to better meet your needs and preferences.

## Product Title Suggester

If you're using WooCommerce, the Title Suggester feature also extends to your product listings.

- Go to **Products - All Products**.
- Hover over the product for which you want a title suggestion, then click on the **Suggest Title** button.
