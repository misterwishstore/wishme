# Comment Replier

Comment Replier is designed to automate and enhance the comment management process on your WordPress website.

This advanced feature leverages the power of artificial intelligence to generate thoughtful and contextually relevant responses to user comments.

By using Comment Replier, website owners can save significant time and effort that's usually spent on drafting manual responses, and instead, focus more on creating quality content.

Tailored to reflect the tone and style of your site, this tool not only provides efficient comment management but also promotes higher engagement, fostering a strong sense of community within your digital space.

Whether you're running a blog, news site, or WooCommerce store, the Comment Replier is here to transform your interaction with your audience, making your digital communication effortless, personalized, and more engaging.

## Configuring Prompt

One of the standout features of Comment Replier is its highly customizable AI prompt.

You can access this setting by navigating to the **Settings - Comment** tab.

Here, you can craft a unique prompt by using dynamic placeholders such as ```[username]```, ```[post_title]```, ```[post_excerpt]```, ```[last_comment]```, and ```[parent_comments]```.

These placeholders provide crucial context to the GPT model, enabling it to generate relevant and accurate responses.

For instance, the default prompt reads:

*"Please generate a relevant and thoughtful response to ```[username]```'s comment on the post titled ```[post_title]``` with the excerpt ```[post_excerpt]```. The user’s latest comment is: ```[last_comment]```. If applicable, consider the context of the previous conversation: ```[parent_comments]```."*

By tailoring this prompt, you can ensure the AI's responses maintain a consistent tone and style that resonates with your site's ethos, making the replies feel more authentic and personalized.
