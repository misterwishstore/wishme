# Questions and Answers

The Questions and Answers feature is a feature that, when enabled, adds questions and answers related to the title of your content.

This helps to provide more in-depth information and address common queries that readers may have about the topic.

This is a Pro feature and requires an upgrade to access.

Number of Q&A is dependent on selected **Number of Headings**. For example, if your number of headings value is 5, then total of 5 Q&A will be generated.
