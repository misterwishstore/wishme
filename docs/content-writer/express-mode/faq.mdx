## Timeout issue

**Q**: I am getting *“It appears that your web server has some kind of timeout limit. This can also occur if you are using a VPS, CDN, proxy, firewall, or Cloudflare. To resolve this issue, please contact your hosting provider and request an increase in the timeout limit.”* message. What should I do?

**A**: It means that your server have timeout limitation.

If you are using **CloudFlare**, their default timeout limit is 100 seconds. Which means you won’t be able to generate content if content generation exceed 100 seconds. You can upgrade your plan with CloudFlare or disable their service or you can reduce number of headings for content generation.

If you are using **Apache** as a web server, please contact your hosting provider to learn what the current timeout value is in ```httpd.conf``` file. You can increase this value.

If you are using **Nginx** as a web server, please contact your hosting provider to learn what the current timeout value is in ```/etc/nginx/conf.d/timeout.conf``` file. You can increase this value.
