# Playground

AI Power's Playground is a dedicated sandbox feature that allows users to test and fine-tune their AI-generated content.

This powerful feature enables users to write their own prompts or use pre-built prompts in various categories and view the AI's output instantly. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to effectively utilize the Playground feature.

## Navigating to the Playground

To access the Playground, navigate to the **Content Writer** menu in your AI Power plugin and select the **Playground** tab.

This menu provides a list of over 10 pre-built categories, including 'WordPress', 'Blogging', 'Writing', 'E-commerce', 'Online Business', 'Entrepreneurship', 'SEO', 'Social Media', 'Digital Marketing', 'WooCommerce', 'Content Strategy', 'Keyword Research', 'Product Listing', and 'Customer Relationship Management'.

Select the category that best aligns with your content creation needs.

## Choosing or Creating Prompts

Once a category is selected, another dropdown menu labeled **Prompt** will appear below it.

This menu contains pre-built prompts relevant to your chosen category.

For example, if you choose **WordPress**, you may find a prompt like *Write a case study on a successful WordPress website, detailing its design, growth strategies, and the impact of its content on its target audience.*

Similarly, for **Blogging**, a prompt might be *Write a blog post on how to effectively monetize a blog, discussing various methods such as affiliate marketing, sponsored content, and display advertising, as well as tips for maximizing revenue.*

Select a pre-built prompt or customize it according to your requirements.

You can also write your own prompt in the textbox provided.

## Generating, Viewing and Saving Output

With your prompt ready, click the 'Generate' button.

The AI will process your prompt and display the output on the right side of the Playground interface.

Review the output to see how well the AI has addressed your prompt.

If you're satisfied with the AI-generated output, you have the option to save it as a draft for future use or reference.
