# Custom Mode

Custom Mode is a feature within our plugin that allows users to generate content with **greater flexibility** compared to Express Mode.

While Express Mode provides one-click content generation, Custom Mode gives users the ability to customize all settings to create content tailored to their specific needs.

## How to Use Custom Mode

Go to the **Content Writer** within the plugin and switch to the **Custom Mode** tab.

### Step 1: Choose Your Title

- Go to the **Custom Mode** tab within the **Content Writer** plugin.
- On the left side, you'll find two radio buttons: **Topic** and **Use My Own title**.
- If you choose **Topic**:
    - Enter a topic (e.g., "mobile phones") in the text field below the radio buttons.
    - Click on **Suggest Titles**. Our plugin will retrieve title suggestions for the given topic.
    - A modal window will appear, displaying the suggestions.
    - Select one of the suggestions, modify it if needed, and click the **Use This** button.
    - The selected title will be appended to the text field.

- If you choose **Use My Own Title**:
    - The **Suggest Titles** button will be hidden.
    - Enter your desired title in the text field without receiving suggestions.
    - (Optional) Adjust the number of title suggestions you'd like to receive using the dropdown menu next to the "Suggest Titles" button (options: 3, 5, 7; 5 is the default).

- Click the **Generate Sections** button to create sections for your content.
- Use the dropdown menu to select the desired number of sections (options: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12; 4 is the default).
- The generated sections will be added to the **Sections** textarea, where you can modify, delete, or add sections as needed.
