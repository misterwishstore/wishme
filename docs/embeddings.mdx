# Embeddings

OpenAI’s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings.

We use this technology to create a semantic search engine, KnowledgeBase and a chat bot.

<iframe width="100%" height="535" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3UQQ5-oNso" title="Create Fully Customized ChatGPT in WordPress with Embeddings and Pinecone" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen></iframe>

To use this feature, you must first create a Pinecone account.

You can think of Pinecone as a long-term external memory for your bot.

:::info
OpenAI charges a cost of $0.0004 per 1,000 tokens for embeddings.

Assuming that 750 words are approximately equal to 1,000 tokens, let's consider a scenario where you have a website with 1,000 pages, and each page has 750 words.

In this case, the website would have a total of 750,000 words, which translates to 1,000,000 tokens. Therefore, the cost of embeddings for the entire website would be $0.40.

Please note that this is only an approximation. For the precise cost, please refer to OpenAI usage.

:::

You can use embeddings for:

- **Chat Bot** - You can use the embeddings feature to create a chat widget that will respond to your visitors’ questions related to your website.
- **Semantic Search** - We have a feature called SearchGPT where you can create your own search engine. You can use the embeddings feature to create a semantic search engine. For example, if you search for “dog”, you will get results for “puppy”, “pooch”, “canine”, “hound”, etc. This is because the embeddings feature will find the most similar text strings to “dog”.

Now let's take a look at all the features in detail.

## Pinecone Setup

To use the Embeddings feature in AI Power, you need to first create an account with Pinecone and obtain your API key.

Here's how:

- Visit [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) to sign up for a new account. 

:::tip

Pinecone is currently experiencing high demand. As a result, new users who wish to sign up for the Starter (free) plan may find themselves placed on a waitlist.

By providing your credit card information for a trial, you can start using Pinecone immediately. Don't worry, if you only wish to use the free plan, you can cancel the subscription after the trial period ends. This way, you can start using the free plan without having to wait.

:::

- Once your account is created, go to the [Pinecone dashboard](https://app.pinecone.io).

<img src={PineconeIndex1} />

This leads to a more efficient and user-friendly navigation experience.

<img src={KnowledgeBaseSample} />

### Product Details

Product details are crucial for any eCommerce site, providing users with all the information they need to make an informed purchasing decision.

By embedding these details, your chatbot can access and relay them to potential customers.

Imagine a clothing store: they can embed details for a particular dress, such as its available sizes, colors, fabric type, and price.

When a user inquires about this dress, the chatbot can quickly provide all these details, facilitating a smooth shopping experience.

To create Product Detail embeddings in the Content Builder, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the **Embeddings - Content Builder** on your dashboard.
- From the dropdown menu of content types, select **Product Details**.
- Now, you will be presented with several input fields including **Product ID**, **Product Name**, **Product Description**, **Product Price**, and **Product URL**. Fill out each of these fields with the relevant details of the product you wish to embed.
    - In the **Product ID** field, input a unique identifier for your product. This could be a SKU, a barcode number, or any other unique identifier used in your inventory system.
    - In the **Product Name** field, input the name of the product as it is listed on your site.
    - In the **Product Description** field, provide a detailed description of the product. This should include information such as its features, uses, and any other details a customer might need to know.
    - In the **Product Price** field, input the current price of the product.
    - Finally, in the **Product URL** field, input the URL of the product page on your website.
- After filling in all the necessary fields, click on the Save button to store your new Product Detail embedding.

<img src={Product} />

Now, your chatbot has access to this embedded product information and can provide it to customers when needed. For example, if a user asks your chatbot, "What is the price of product X?", your chatbot can provide the saved price from the product details you've embedded.

<img src={ProductSample} />

### URLs

Embedding URLs can greatly enhance your website's navigation and overall user experience.

For instance, you can embed the URL of a new blog post, a product page, or a registration form.

Your chatbot can then provide these direct links when a user needs them.

For instance, a user might ask your chatbot, "Where can I register for the upcoming webinar?" Your chatbot can then provide the direct URL to the registration page, guiding the user efficiently.

Creating URL embeddings is a straightforward process.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

- First, navigate to the **Embeddings - Content Builder** on your dashboard.
- From the dropdown menu of content types, select **URL**.
- You'll be presented with input fields for the URL and its associated description. Start by typing the URL you want to embed in the first field.
- In the description field, provide some context about the URL. This could be a brief summary of the page it leads to or its relevance to your website or business.

<img src={URLs} />

- Once you've filled in both fields, click on the **Save** button to store your new URL embedding.

<img src={URLSample} />

- Now that you have created your URL embedding, your chatbot can access this information and share it with users as needed. For example, if a user asks, "Where can I register for the upcoming webinar?", your chatbot can directly provide the saved URL for the registration page. This leads to a more efficient and user-friendly navigation experience.

### Company Profile

A well-crafted company profile gives your website a professional feel, offering visitors insight into your business's history, goals, and achievements.

By embedding this profile, your chatbot can share it with interested users or direct them to the page where it's hosted.

Here's how to create Company Profile embeddings:

- First, go to the **Embeddings - Content Builder** section on your dashboard.
- From the dropdown menu of content types, select **Company Profile**.
- You'll now see input fields where you can enter relevant information about your company:
    - **Company Name:** Enter the official name of your company.
    - **Founder:** Input the name of the person or people who founded the company.
    - **CEO:** Enter the name of your current CEO.
    - **Founded:** Input the year your company was founded.
    - **Location:** Type in the city and country where your company is based.
    - **Number of Employees:** Input the current number of employees in your company.
    - **Industry:** Indicate the industry in which your company operates.
    - **Products:** Provide a brief list or description of your main products or services.
    - **Company Website:** Input the URL of your company's official website.
    - **Company Email:** Input the general contact email for your company.
    - **Company Phone:** Input the general contact phone number for your company.
    - **Company Address:** Type in your company's physical address.
    - **Company Description:** Provide a detailed overview of your company, including its mission, achievements, and any other notable information.
- After you've filled out all the fields, click the **Save** button to create your new Company Profile embedding.

<img src={CompanyProfile} />

With this information embedded, your chatbot can provide users with comprehensive and accurate information about your company. As always, remember that the accuracy of your chatbot in providing these responses depends on its programming and configuration.

For instance, if a user asks, "What does your company do?", the chatbot can pull from the 'Description' field to provide a comprehensive answer.

<img src={CompanySample} />

:::

By using this feature, you can enhance the functionality and effectiveness of your AI-powered chatbot, making it an even more powerful tool for delivering high-quality, contextually relevant responses to user inquiries.

## Index Builder

To be able to use Index Builder you need to setup a cron job.

### Configuring Cron Jobs

- Follow the steps outlined in this guide to [set up a Cron Job](/docs/AutoGPT/gpt-agents#cron-job-setup).
- Ensure that you include the specific PHP command for the Embeddings job in your Cron Job configuration to make it functional.
- You can find your php command under **Embeddings - Settings** tab.

<img src={Cron} />

Your PHP command may vary depending on your server setup.

For the Embeddings module, you need to set up only one cron job.

**Embeddings**:

```bash
* * * * * php /var/www/html/index.php -- wpaicg_builder=yes 
```

Learn how to setup a cron job [here](/docs/AutoGPT/gpt-agents#cron-job-setup).

This is how my Cron setup looks like.

<img src={CronSample} />

Once the Cron Job setup is complete, you should see a message stating, “Great! It looks like your Cron Job is running properly. You should now be able to use the Index Builder."

### Configuring the Index Builder

Once you have set up the Cron Job, you can start using the Index Builder. Here's how:

- Navigate to the **Embeddings - Index Builder** tab in AI Power.
- Toggle the **Cron Indexing** option to **Yes**. Please note that enabling this option will start indexing your website content. Moreover, every time you create a new post, page, or product, it will be indexed automatically.
- Check the box for **Posts, Pages, and Products**.

<img src={CronIndex} width="500" />

- Click on the **Save** button.
- Wait for the indexing process to finish.
- You can track the progress of the indexing in the Index Builder tab.

### Indexing Custom Post Types

The Pro plan of AI Power offers the ability to index custom post types.

Once you have upgraded to the Pro plan, you can navigate to the **Embeddings - Settings** tab.

Here, you will find the option **Build Index for:**. If you have any custom post types, they will be listed here.

<img src={CustomPost} width="500" />

For each custom post type, you will find a button labeled **Select Fields** next to it.

Clicking on this button will open a modal window where you can select fields and assign them labels.

<img src={CustomPostFields} width="500" />

These metadata will be added into the embeddings to deliver better search results.

### Using the Index Builder

The Index Builder is a powerful tool that allows you to manage and monitor the indexing of your website's content. Once your Cron job is set up and running, all your content will be indexed and appear under the **Embeddings - Index Builder** tab in the AI Power.

The Index Builder is divided into three tabs:

- **Indexed**: This tab displays a list of pages that have been successfully indexed.
- **Failed**: This tab lists the pages that failed to index. There can be several reasons why a page may not index, but the most common issue is related to encoding. If your pages have encoding problems, they may fail to index. To resolve this, you need to clean them up.
- **Skipped**: This tab shows a list of pages that have been skipped. The Index Builder does not index pages if their content is **less than 50 characters**. Therefore, if you have **shortcodes** or other content that is less than 50 characters, they will likely not be indexed.

<img src={IndexBuilder} />

#### Understanding the Index List

The index list displays several columns:

- **Title**: This is the title of the page, post, product, or custom post type. It is clickable, and once clicked, it will show the embedded content.
- **Token**: Estimated token usage.
- **Estimated**: Estimated cost. OpenAI charges for embeddings based on the number of tokens, with the rate being **$0.0004 per 1K tokens**.
- **Source**: This shows the type of content that has been indexed (page, post, product, or custom post type).
- **Status**: This shows the status of the indexing process.
- **Start**: This shows the time when the indexing process started.
- **Completed**: This shows the time when the indexing process completed.

#### Managing Your Indexes

Under the **Action** column, there are two buttons:

- **Reindex**: This button allows you to reindex the content. This is particularly useful when you have updated a post, page, or product and you want the index to reflect the latest changes.
- **Delete**: This button allows you to delete an index.

Through the Index Builder, you have full control over the indexing process, ensuring your website's content is properly embedded for optimal use by the AI Power plugin.

## FAQ

### Maximum Context Length

What does the error message *"This model’s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, you requested 4893 tokens"* mean?

This error message indicates that the total number of tokens (which include individual words and punctuation) in the content you're trying to generate is exceeding the maximum limit of 4097 tokens allowed by the model. Tokens are the smallest units of meaning that the model can process, and the limit exists to ensure optimal model performance. There are two primary ways to address this:

- **Lower the maximum token value**: You can adjust the maximum token value to a lower number in your plugin settings. We recommend setting it to 500-700 tokens for optimal performance without losing the quality of output.
- **Split your content into chunks**: If you are dealing with large content, consider dividing it into smaller pieces. Each piece should ideally not be more than 1000 words. This will ensure that each chunk of content remains within the model's token limit, and thus can be processed efficiently.
