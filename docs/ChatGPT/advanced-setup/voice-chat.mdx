# Voice Chat

With our chatbot, we understand the importance of creating a more interactive and engaging experience for your users.

Therefore, we've integrated with top-notch voice technologies to elevate your chatbot interaction.

- **Voice Input**: For voice input, we've integrated with **Whisper**, which is a **Speech-to-Text** model from OpenAI. With this feature, your users can speak directly to the chatbot using their microphone, and the chatbot will transcribe and process their spoken words as if they were typed messages.
- **Voice Output**: You can enable voice output for your chatbot with our integrations with **ElevenLabs** and **Google Text to Speech**. This allows your chatbot to read out its responses, creating a more dynamic and conversational experience for your users.

By combining these features, you can create a seamless voice chat experience for your users, making your chatbot more accessible and intuitive to use.

## Voice Input

You can enable or disable the voice input.

If you enable this option, the chatbot will display a microphone icon.

When the user clicks on the microphone icon, the chatbot will start listening to the user.

The user can speak to the chatbot and the chatbot will convert the speech to text. You can customize mic and stop button color.

### Whisper Integration

Whisper is an advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI.

It's designed to convert spoken language into written text, and it's trained on a large amount of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.

Integrating Whisper with our chatbot can elevate the user experience, providing a hands-free mode of interaction that is particularly useful for users who are visually impaired, have motor disabilities, or simply prefer voice interaction.

Here's how you can enable and customize the Whisper integration:

<img src={Google} width="400" />

- Upon selecting **Google**, four new dropdown options will appear:
    - **Voice Language**: This option allows you to select the language in which you want the text to be converted to speech. Google supports a wide range of languages.
    - **Voice Name**: This refers to the specific voice model that you want to use for the speech output. Each language usually has multiple voice models (male, female, variations in accent, etc.).
    - **Audio Device Profile**: This option lets you optimize the audio output for specific types of devices, such as headphones, smartphones, or speakers, to ensure the best possible sound quality.
    - **Voice Speed**: This allows you to control the speed (pace) at which the text is read aloud. A higher value will speed up the speech, while a lower value will slow it down.
    - **Voice Pitch**: This option lets you adjust the tonal quality of the voice. A higher value will make the voice sound higher-pitched (like a chipmunk), while a lower value will make it sound deeper.
- Adjust these settings as desired and click **Save**.

Congratulations, you have successfully integrated Google Text-to-Speech with your Custom ChatGPT!

Your bot is now equipped to speak with a voice of your choosing.

#### Limitations

While the new ElevenLabs voice integration with ChatGPT brings exciting possibilities for chatbot creators, it’s important to be aware of its limitations.

Understanding these restrictions will help you make informed decisions when using this feature.

- **Language Support**: Currently, ElevenLabs only supports the English language. This means that you cannot use their text-to-speech services for non-English languages. However, additional language support may become available in the future.
- **API Errors**: If you choose to hide API errors in chat, users won’t see errors like “out of quota” or “invalid API key.” Instead, they will only see the chat text from OpenAI without any audio from ElevenLabs. This could lead to confusion if users expect to hear a voice response.
- **Quota Restrictions**: Depending on the ElevenLabs plan you choose, you may face limitations in terms of characters per month, custom voices, and commercial licensing. The free plan, for example, offers 10,000 characters per month and up to 3 custom voices without a commercial license.

By being aware of these limitations, you can make the most of the ElevenLabs voice integration with ChatGPT and create unique, engaging experiences for your chatbot users.
