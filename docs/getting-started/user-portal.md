As a paid user, you can:

## Receiving Your Portal Credentials
After successfully completing your payment, you will receive an email containing your login credentials for the User Portal.

## Website Management
Within the User Portal, you can manage all of your websites from a central location. Add new sites, remove old ones, or change details at any time. This can be done through the following link: [Manage Websites](https://users.freemius.com/websites)

### Moving a license from one website to another
Go to the **Websites** section. Click on the row of the website that currently has the license activated. If there are multiple products running on that site, the next screen will show you all of those products. Simply click on the relevant product to open the details panel, where you’ll be able to click the Deactivate button under the LICENSE section.

After the license is deactivated, you’ll be able to reuse it on any other website.

### Upgrading from a single site license to an N-sites license
Navigate to the subscriptions section by clicking on the **Renewals & Billing**  menu item. Locate the subscription that you'd like to upgrade its license's sites limit and select it by clicking on its row. This will open the subscription’s advanced panel.

## Payments
Track your payment history, view past invoices, or update your payment details at this link: [Payments](https://users.freemius.com/payments)

### Obtaining a PDF invoice for your payments
You can access all of your payments in the **Orders History** section. To get a PDF invoice of a payment, just click **Invoice** button of the payment’s record.

### Adding a Tax/VAT ID and business details to your invoices

If you didn't enter a Tax/VAT ID during checkout, then it's entirely possible to do it afterward. It is often important to have this identifier displayed on invoices you receive after a purchase.

Go to **My Profile** and simply update the billing information. Now, if you go to the **Orders History**, the invoices will include your Tax/VAT ID.

### Updating your payment method, credit card, or PayPal
Navigate to the subscriptions section by clicking on the **Renewals & Billing**  menu item. Locate the subscription that you'd like to update its payment method and select it by clicking on its row. This will open the subscription’s advanced panel. Then, click on the Update button next to the payment method, and checkout with your new payment method. The initial payment will be automatically prorated based on the next renewal date.

### Canceling your recurring subscription
You can access all your active subscriptions via the **Renewals & Billing** section. Active subscriptions will have a green label on the STATUS column and will start with AUTO RENEW ON. Simply click the row of the subscription that you’d like to cancel to access the subscription’s advanced panel, and then click the Cancel Auto-Renew button.

You’ll be prompted with a confirmation dialog, giving you the option to set up an email reminder instead of canceling right away. If you do proceed with the cancellation you’ll get a short feedback form where you can let us know why you are canceling the subscription. Your feedback is appreciated and will help us improve our offering. That said, the feedback is optional, so whether you provide it or not, hit the Send & Cancel renewals button to complete the subscription cancellation.
