# Activating the Pro Version

## Download the plugin

After purchasing a product, **you will be sent 2 emails**. The first will provide you with a link to download the plugin, along with your license key.

The second email, which you’ll receive after the payment is successfully processed, will provide a receipt, as well as a secure link to download your PDF invoice.

If you purchased a lifetime license you’ll only receive a single email combining the secure download link, license key, receipt, and PDF invoice.

Before downloading the plugin, if you are using Apple's Safari as your browser, disable its default ZIP auto extraction setting:

## Activate the plugin with your License Key

If you’ve purchased the plugin directly within the WP Admin dashboard you are already good to go since the license key is automatically activated right after the upgrade. Otherwise, after activating the plugin, you will be redirected to a license activation screen.

Simply enter the key provided in your email and click **Agree & Activate License**. Your product will now be activated and you'll be ready to begin setting it up.

## Downloading older versions of the plugin

Go to the **Downloads** section and look for the Download text. Click on the  expand_more icon beside it. It will open a menu with previous versions of a product.

Click on the version you want to download.
