# Semantic Search

Our plugin offers a semantic search feature called **SearchGPT**.

You can use this feature to enhance the search functionality of your website.

To use the SearchGPT feature, you must have a Pinecone API key entered under the **Embeddings - Settings** page.

You can learn how to setup Pinecone [here](/docs/embeddings#pinecone-setup).

SearchGPT uses OpenAI embeddings and Pinecone vector database integration to provide a powerful semantic search experience.

Semantic search is a type of search that uses machine learning algorithms to understand the intent behind a search query and find results that are related to that intent, rather than just matching specific keywords.

To use the SearchGPT feature, simply copy the following shortcode and paste it into the page or post where you want to show the search box:

``[wpaicg_search]``

<img src={Search} />

Once you've added the shortcode, you can customize the SearchGPT feature from the ** Settings - SearchGPT** page.

Here, you can customize the placeholder message, font size, font color, border color, background color, width, and height for the search box.

You can also customize the results, including the number of nearest results (from 1 to 5), font size, font color, background color, and in-progress background color.
