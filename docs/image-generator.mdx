## DALL-E

DALL-E is a deep learning model developed by OpenAI to generate digital images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts".

You can generate images from simple text prompts by using Image Generator feature.

- Make sure you have the [API key](/docs/ai-engine/openai/api-key.mdx) for DALL-E and you have entered it in the plugin settings.

<img src={APIKey} width="700" />

- Go to **Image Generator** and enter a prompt in the text field.
- Click on the **Generate** button.
- Wait for the images to be generated.

<img src={ImageGenerator} width="700" />

- Simply click on an image to delve into its details. While our plugin automatically assigns the prompt as **alternative text**, **caption**, **description**, and **title**, you have the freedom to modify them as per your preference.

<img src={DalleModal} width="700" />

- You can select the image you like the most and click on the **Save to Media** button to save the image to your WordPress Media Library.

DALL-E supports **256x256**, **512x512**, and **1024x1024** image sizes and can generate up to **6 images** per request.

:::info

Not all requests made to OpenAI will result in an image being returned. OpenAI filters both prompts and images in accordance with their [content policy](https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy), and if either is flagged, an error will be returned.

This is the error message that will be displayed if the request is not in compliance with OpenAI's content policy:

*"Your request was rejected as a result of our safety system. Your prompt may contain text that is not allowed by our safety system."*

## Shortcodes

Integrating AI-driven image generators into your website can significantly enhance user experience by providing interactive features.

This guide will explain how you can easily embed the DALL-E and Stable Diffusion image generators into your website using shortcodes.

### What are shortcodes?

Shortcodes are small pieces of code that you can insert into your website's posts or pages to execute a specific function or display a feature.

In this case, the shortcodes will display the DALL-E and Stable Diffusion image generators.

### How to Use Shortcodes

Firstly, decide where you would like to display the image generator. This could be in a post or a page. Then, open the editor of that post or page.

#### Displaying Both DALL-E and Stable Diffusion

To allow users to generate images using both the DALL-E and Stable Diffusion models, use the following shortcode:

```
[wpcgai_img]
```

Simply copy and paste it into the text editor where you'd like the generators to appear.

#### Displaying Only DALL-E

If you prefer to offer only the DALL-E model, use the following shortcode:

```
[wpcgai_img dalle=yes]
```

Copy this shortcode and paste it into the desired location.

#### Displaying Only Stable Diffusion

To display only the Stable Diffusion model, use the following shortcode:

```
[wpcgai_img sd=yes]
```

Again, copy this shortcode and paste it into the desired location.

#### Displaying the Settings

To include settings alongside your image generator, you can use the following shortcodes:

```
[wpcgai_img settings=yes]
[wpcgai_img dalle=yes settings=yes]
[wpcgai_img sd=yes settings=yes]
```

These shortcodes display the settings panel which allows users to customize their image generation experience. 

Simply choose the appropriate shortcode and paste it where you'd like the settings to appear.

After you've inserted the desired shortcode, save your changes.

Your image generator, based on the shortcode you used, should now be visible and interactive on your website.

Remember, by embedding these AI-driven image generators on your website, you are not only enhancing the aesthetic appeal of your site, but also providing a unique, engaging, and interactive experience for your users.

## Price Handling

The Image Generator provides a robust price handling feature that allows you to control and limit the usage of the generator based on **user roles** and **registration status**.

This can be found under the **Settings tab** in the **Image Generator**.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use this feature.

- **Limit Registered User**: This setting allows you to decide whether to place a limit on registered users. To enable this feature, check the corresponding box. If you don't want to limit registered users, leave the checkbox unmarked.
- **Price Limit for Registered Users**: This is where you define the limit **in dollar** terms for registered users. Enter the maximum amount you want each registered user to be able to spend on image generation.
- **Role-based Limit**: This feature allows you to set individual price limits for **different user roles** on your Wordpress site. Clicking on **Set Limit** will open a modal window displaying all the user roles in your Wordpress site. Here, you can assign a specific limit for each role.

<img src={RoleLimit} width="500" />

- **Limit Non-Registered User**: This setting is similar to **Limit Registered User**, but it applies to non-registered users. To enable this feature, check the corresponding box. If you don't want to limit non-registered users, leave the checkbox unmarked.
- **Price Limit for Non-Registered Users**: This setting allows you to define the limit **in dollar** terms for non-registered users. Enter the maximum amount you want each non-registered user to be able to spend on image generation.
- **Notice**: Here, you can customize the message that users will see when they reach their limit. For example, *"You have reached your limit"*.
- **Reset Limit**: This setting defines the interval at which the limit will reset. You can choose from **Never**, **1 day**, **3 days**, **1 week**, **2 weeks**, **1 month**, **2 months**, **3 months** or **6 months**. Selecting **Never** will mean that the limit does not reset, and users will have to wait until the next reset interval to generate more images if they reach their limit.

Remember to click **Save** once you're done adjusting these settings to ensure all changes are applied.

This feature gives you great flexibility in managing usage and costs associated with the Image Generator on your site.

### Limitations

- Please note that our plugin is not capable of tracking usage for the 'Stable Diffusion' feature due to constraints in the provided API. This feature does not supply the necessary information for our plugin to track its usage effectively. Therefore, if you plan to implement a usage-based charge system for your users, we advise against enabling the 'Stable Diffusion' feature.
- Regarding DALL-E usage, OpenAI adopts a different charging scheme. Unlike most features that are charged based on the number of tokens used, DALL-E usage is charged on a dollar basis. This means the cost for using DALL-E is not calculated based on the number of tokens, but instead corresponds directly to a monetary value. Please keep this in mind while utilizing the DALL-E feature.

## Token Sale

You can charge your users for their use of our image generation tools.

Our integration with WooCommerce allows you to sell tokens, which users can purchase and utilize to access and enjoy the image creation features on your site.

Dive into a new revenue stream while providing value to your users.

Learn more about it here: [User Account Management & Token Sale](/docs/user-management-token-sale)

## Customization of Interface Texts

Our image generator plugin allows you to customize various elements of the interface to better fit your website's style and user interaction.

The elements that you can customize include:

- **Surprise Me**: This text appears on the button that triggers a random prompt for image generation. You can customize it to any string that suits your preference.
- **Generate**: This is the button text that initiates the image generation process. You can change it to align with your website's language or tone.
- **View Image**: This text is displayed on the button that opens the generated image for a detailed view. If you prefer a different label, you can adjust it here.
- **Save to Media**: This text appears on the button that allows users to save the generated image to their media library. You can customize it to fit your website's style.
- **Select All**: This button text is used to select all generated images. You can replace it with a string of your choice.

## Surprise Me Prompts

This feature allows you to define a list of prompts that will randomly appear when the user clicks the **Surprise Me** button.

Each prompt should be listed on a separate line.

<img src={Surprise} />

If you leave this field empty, the plugin will use the default set of prompts.

This allows you to add an element of surprise and randomness to the user's experience, and can be customized to suit the theme or purpose of your website.

## Logs

Logs feature offers an insightful overview of the activities on your site related to the image generation process.

This feature is located under the **Image Generator - Logs** tab in your plugin.

<img src={Logs} />

Each row in the log table provides the following details:

- **Prompt**: The initial input or phrase provided by the user for image generation.
- **Image Size**: The dimensions of the generated image.
- **Total Images**: The total number of images generated for a given prompt.
- **Source**: The specific page or location where the image was generated.
- **Shortcode**: The shortcode used to trigger the image generation.
- **Duration**: The time taken for the image generation process.
- **Estimated Cost**: An approximation of the cost incurred for the image generation.
- **Created At**: The timestamp when the image was generated.

In addition, a search box is available for you to quickly locate specific log entries.

This can be particularly useful for **auditing**, **troubleshooting**, or understanding user behavior related to image generation on your site.

Just type your search term into the search box and hit Enter to retrieve matching log entries.
